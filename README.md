# Visualsort

Visualsort borns as a program to exploit the capabilities of [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) gaming library (and having fun with Go).

It's aim is to provide a visual representation of the most popular in-memory [sorting algorithms (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm).

## Algorightms

- [x] **Quick Sort**: I effectively use the Go Lib implementation that should be a randomized version
- [x] **Bubble Sort**
- [x] **Bubble Sort 2**: fast end
- [x] **Insertion Sort**
- [x] **Selection Sort**
- [x] **Shell Sort**
- [ ] **Cocktail Sort**
- [ ] **Merge Sort**

## Usage

Visualsort is a command line utility.

Just run `visualsort` to get a visual representation of quicksort (one of the best algorithm (not the "best" in the sense it's not an "optimal" solution for the problem of "in-memory sorting") implemented in many system libraries.

You can customize speed, delay, algorithm, data set and many more options for the sake of your experiments.

### Command Options

For a complete list of options issue the interactive help: `visualsort -h`.

Some of them are treated here:

- _asc_: will use a data set ordered in ascending
- _desc_: will use a data set ordered in descending
- _delay_: will retard the the start of the game by an amount of seconds. Useful for video recording
- _seed_: set a random seed. Useful to compare algorithms with similar data sets
- _size_: the size of the data set
- _speed_: the speed of the animation

## Installation

It would suffice

```
 go get github.com/MrBogomips/visualsort
```

## Contribution

This project started for fun to explore Go and Pixel gaming library.
The code should deserve better organization and many more algos (notably **Mergesort**).

Neverthless… if you found another sorting algorithm to share…
